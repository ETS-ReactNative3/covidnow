COVIDNOW is a mobile application partnered with Mt. Sinai that helps underserved communities in NYC navigate the pandemic.
The first version of the application focuses on mapping the CBOs in Brookyln.
The application was initiated with the React Native Starter Kit, so not all files are relevant to the application.

To launch the application, please install the IOS/Android Simulator using XCode. 

Run the following once you have cloned the project:

npm install
react-native start
for ios: react-native run-ios
for android: react-native run-android
